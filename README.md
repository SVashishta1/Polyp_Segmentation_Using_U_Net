Polyp Segmentation Using U-Net

Overview

This project utilizes the U-Net architecture for segmenting polyps from medical images. Accurate polyp segmentation is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of diseases like colorectal cancer. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of medical images and corresponding masks.
